This paper introduces and rationalizes a new model for bidding and clearing energy storage resources in wholesale energy markets. Charge and discharge bids in this model are dependent on the storage state-of-charge (SoC). In this setting, storage participants submit different bids for each SoC segment. The system operator monitors the storage SoC, and updates their bids accordingly in market clearings. Combined with an optimal bidding design algorithm using dynamic programming, our paper shows that the SoC segment model provides more accurate representations of the opportunity costs of energy storage compared to existing power-based bidding models, and captures the inherent nonlinear operational characteristics of energy storage. We benchmark the SoC segment model against an existing single-segment storage model in both price-taker and price-influencer simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed model improves profits by 10-60% and reduces system cost by 5% in comparison to the existing power-based bidding model, and helps reduce price volatilities.
